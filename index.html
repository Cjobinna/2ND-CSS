        <p>The man who saved a billion lives</p>
        <img src="1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>
         <br> <br>
        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, lowa</li>
            <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the university of minnesota, <br> thanks to a Depression
                era
                program known as the "National <br> Youth Administration"</li>
            <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civillian <br> Conservation Corps,
                helping starving americans. "I saw how <br> food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
                me".
            </li>
            <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US forestry service</li>
            <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to <br> budget cuts. Inspired by
                Elvin
                Charles Stakman, he returns to school <br> study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest
                <br>
                -resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but <br> is rejected. Instead,
                the
                military asked his lab to work on waterproof <br> glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
                other
                applied <br> science.</li>
            <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies
                to
                Mexico
                to head a new plant pathology <br> program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                <br>
                strains
                of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for <br> each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling <br> wheat yields</li>
            <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high <br>
                -yeidling American breed, creating a
                strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br> Indian subcontinent in
                time
                to <br>
                help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their <br> maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M university</li>
            <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050. <br> " Argues that genetically
                modified
                crops <br> are the only way we can <br> meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
                crops <br> are
                not
                inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically <br> modifying plants and animals for a long
                time.
                Long
                before we called <br> it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching <br> contribution that one man's towering
                intellect, persistent and <br> scientific vision can make to human peace and progress".</i></p>
